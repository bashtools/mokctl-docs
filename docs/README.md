1. [Single Node](/docs/build.md)
   
   Setting up a single node cluster in containers by hand.

2. [Package](/docs/package.md)
   
   Packaging the commands we used into an application.

3. [Testing and Fixing](/docs/testfix.md)
   
   Finding and fixing any problems.

4. [Kubernetes the Hard Way](https://github.com/my-own-kind/kubernetes-the-hard-way-in-containers)
   
   The classic remade for MOK. A 7 node cluster without blowing up your laptop!

5. [Multi Node](/docs/multinode.md)
   
   Build a bigger cluster using our package.

   We can install any version of kubernetes. Let's try installing an older cluster and upgrading it.
